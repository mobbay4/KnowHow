# Access Tokens

[Gitlab Help]

***Really important***: Access Tokens have a name in Gitlab.
But the real thing you need is a cryptic string displayed after generating the token, see the picture below.
This string is only shown after creating the token.
You have to save it somewhere, maybe there where you save your passwords.
