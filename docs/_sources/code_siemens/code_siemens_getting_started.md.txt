# Getting Started with code siemens

[code.Siemens] is a platform to collaborate on code internally, and this guide should help you do all the necessary steps for using it.
Note that this guide mentions only the basics. To gain a deeper understanding, have a look at the [code.Siemens-documentation]. There
you can find a lot of informative material, learning videos, and so on.

## First Steps

### Login

At first, you have to sign up. To do so, go on the [code.siemens.com login website]. After your first login, your username will be automatically derived from your email address.

### The SSH-Key

The next step is to configure the SSH key. The SSH key is the most pleasant way to authenticate on [code.Siemens]. It is, for example, used to clone a repository, which is the first step to contribute or use a repository. After completing this SSH tutorial section, you can learn [here how to clone a repository]. To generate an SSH key, follow this [instruction][instructions: generate ssh key].

When key generation is complete, we have to add the SSH public key to your code.siemens profile. To add the key to your profile, go into your profile preferences and the SSH key section. There you can add the **public key**, give it a title and configure its access rights. This picture explains where to find it:

Now you can authenticate via SSH!
Note that you need to know the password of the SSH-key pair to use it.
