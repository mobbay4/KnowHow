# MkDocs

To use MkDocs, one can use the [MkDocs-Blueprint-Repository] to include all significant MkDocs files.
This blueprint repository also includes an adaption guide in the README.md file, which explains how to adjust the given files to your project needs.

## Hints

- We can use **mkDocs** to integrate ReadMe-files into a Website. But relative links are not possible.
  - Mk-docs uses external files
  - `--<8--` is an include command

- Every Markdown file that is in the docs folder is rendered on the website. But if there is no headline for the file in the nav of mkdoc.yml, the files can only be accessed through search.

### Include csv files as tables

To include a csv file into your documentation one can use the [mkdocs-table-reader-plugin]. Just install it add this to your `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - table-reader
```

Now you can include csv files as tables like this:

```Markdown
{{ read_csv('docs\\test.csv') }}
```

## nav section

Note that a section cannot have a page assigned to it. Sections are only containers for child pages and sub-sections. See [Documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)

The following error is raised, if a page is assigned to a section:

```PowerShell
Error: MkDocs encountered an error parsing the configuration file: while parsing a block mapping
  in "/builds/lmc_messtechnik/rollinlok_speicher/mkdocs.yml", line 75, column 5
expected <block end>, but found '-'
  in "/builds/lmc_messtechnik/rollinlok_speicher/mkdocs.yml", line 76, column 5
```
