# Markdown

In this section the information on the "standard" Markdown syntax is noted down.

For MyST see section [MySt](./MyST.md)

To check for new information visit [Railigent Documentation][railigent_docs_markdown] (Martin has access)

## Some hints

### Jumpmarks

- Marks for example headings. In our case Jumpmark = `#`.
  There are some Markdown interpreter don`t use Jumpmarks.

### Links

Its recomended to define a Link at the end of the Markdown-document. This keeps your document readable and its clear where to find the Links.

#### network drives

Refer to network drives: `file://///ad001.siemens.net/dfs001/File`

#### to markdown documents

Links to line of markdown code (only for GitLab): Add a #L and the line number at the end of the Link to the Markdown file. Example: `.md#L5`

### Create a copy button

  With copy button we mean here the button in the final sphinx documentation that allows to copy everything of in a given code block with one click.
    - Sphinx: copy button

### Embed HTML file in markdown file

To do so one can just add the following line somewhere in the Markdown file and adjust the file-path:

```html
<iframe src="path/to/filename.html" height="1000px" width="100%></iframe>

```

With this you can for example add interactive (plotly) plots to your documentation. See also the [corresponding stackoverflow page][embed html stackoverflow page].

## Show Markdown code in rendered file

For short texts use the `` for code-highlighting to show the Markdown code. Example: `[test-picture](./artwork/test_picture.png)`.

The following is not officially documented. The syntax was extracted from the source files of [MyST website].
If you want to show markdown blocks in the markdown block, add a `.

`````md
````md
```md
```
````
`````

## Math

use the $ sign to surround Latex Formulas.
For example:

`$x^n + y^n = z^n$`

renders to:

$x^n + y^n = z^n$

## markdown conventions for SC

This Chapter establishes the markdown conventions for SC.

### links

Place links at the end of the markdown document.
The links are sorted alphabetically by the reference names.

See following example:

```md
Here's [a link to something else][another_place].
Here's [yet another link][another_link].
And now back to [the first link][another_place].

[another_link]: www.google.com
[another_place]: www.github.com
```

#### links to markdown documents

The reference of the link starts with `md_`, see th following example:

```md
Here's [a link to a markdown file][md_another_md_file]

[md_another_md_file]: ./another_file.md
```
