# general hints for spyde IDE

## insallation

recomanded ways (see [documentation][spyder_installation]):

- stand allone installers
- Anaconda

not recomended:

- pip (worked for me, but as it has no advantage (spyder notebook does not work either see [spyder-notebook](#spyder-notebook)), also depreceated)

## use a venv in spyder

1. The venv you want to use must have package `spyder-kernels` installed (2021.08  spyder-kernels==2.1.*). Otherwise no ipython konsole can be started --> no debugging and variabel viewing is possible.
2. Change the python.exe Spyder uses. The python.exe of an venv is in the **Scripts** folder, e.g.: `D:/python_venv/DataAnalyse/Scripts/python.exe`

## spyder notebook

A plugin to use jupyter notebooks within spyder, see [documentation]:[spyder_notebook]

2021.11: At the moment it is not possible to use this plugin with the Spyder Standalone installers for Windows and macOS. We're working to make that possible in the future.
***So don`t use syder notebooks at the moment***

It is also not posible to use the spyder-notebook if spyder and spyder notebook are installed in a venv from pip.
It makes no difference if spyder is installed on the pc from the windows installer.
