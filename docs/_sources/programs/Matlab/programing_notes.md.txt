### Parameterizing Functions (functionhandles)

The source is the Matlab help page [parametrize functions].

#### Parameterizing Using Anonymous Functions

`Understanding of Martin ZÃ¤ch: An anonymous function is a function handle that is created in a one-liner of code. This one-liner can hold the function logic as in the following example.`

The following is a copy from the [parametrize functions] page.

```{code-block} matlab
b = 2;
c = 3.5;
cubicpoly = @(x) x^3 + b*x + c;
x = fzero(cubicpoly,0)
```

You also can use anonymous functions to call more complicated objective functions that you define in a function file. For example, suppose you have a file named cubicpoly.m with this function definition:

```{code-block} matlab
function y = cubicpoly(x,b,c)
y = x^3 + b*x + c;
end
```

At the command line, define b and c, and then call fzero with an anonymous function that invokes cubicpoly:

```{code-block} matlab
b = 2;
c = 3.5;
x = fzero(@(x) cubicpoly(x,b,c),0)
```

Anonymous function with more than one input value remaining doe also work.
So if the argument c from the pervious example "cubicpoly" should stay a parameter of the function, use the following:

```{code-block} matlab
anonym_func = @(x,c) cubicpoly(x,b,c)
```
