## CI-Pi

Matlab offers the opportunity to use a CI-Workflow for Simulink Modells.
The following article gives an example. The project used in this example is available on GitHub® and File Exchange for download.

```{warning} The article mentions licenses. Clarify if the licenses are available in Siemens before you move on.
If you plan to perform CI on many hosts or the cloud, contact MathWorks (continuous-integration@mathworks.com) for help. Note: transformational products such as MathWorks coder and compiler products may require client access licenses (CAL).

## S-function level 1

 Note that Level-1 S-functions are no longer supported, and only exist for backward compatibility reasons. Please convert it to a Level-2 MATLAB S-function if possible. Type `sfcndemo_sfundsc2` at the MATLAB prompt to open a Level-1 S-function example that uses a state to store the value of the previous input (thus acting as a Unit Delay). Type `msfcndemo_sfundsc2` to see the Level-2 S-function version of the same algorithm.

## S-functions level 2

A video Intruduction is given here: [S_func_level2_01].

## S-function Builder

[S_func_builder_matlab_help_01]

Additionally, the S-function Builder block is a masked version of the S-function block that includes an easy-to-use editor that automatically builds an S-function out of a core algorithm that you enter into it along with input, output, and parameter attributes. By default, the S-function Builder also creates a TLC file for use with Simulink® Coder™ and Embedded Coder™.
