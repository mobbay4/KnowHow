## ways offerd by mathworks

If you create a Toolbox, you can [Display Custom Documentation]. Therefor you must create html pages.

Matlab offers two ways to create html-pages from your code, both documented on [Publish and Share MATLAB Code]:

- Create and Share Live Scripts in the Live Editor
- Publish MATLAB Code Files (.m). This requires some [Publishing Markup] syntax in the .m-file.

## with third party tools

Starting from this [matworks forum post] the possible ways of auto document Matlab code are given below.
If there is no other information, the date when the sources are analyzed was 2021.08.05.

### m2docgen

[m2docgen] is a Toolbox for Matlab provided by a third-party developer.
The principle is similar to the Sphinx autodoc in python.

Advantage:

- it can be used when just Matlab is installed on the PC.

### Matlab report generator

[matlab report generator] is a Toolbox for Matlab provided by Mathworks.

It is purpose is report generation, but according to a post of the Matlab staff, it can also be used to autodoc Matlab code.

### sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain

[sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain] is an sphinx extension to autodoc maltab code.

It works similar to the sphinx autodoc extension for python code.
For sphinx see [sphinx documentation][md_sphinx].

```{note}
The docstring of the matlab modules / functions / objects etc. must be written in markdown.
As style for the docstrings the [python docstring Google Style] is recomended for SMO RS LMC EN.
```

For a hint wath is all documented, you can have a look at the Test folder.

Advantage:

- when code siemens is used as a repository for Matlab code, the documentation can be built by GitLab-CI. Also, the documentation page can be hosted by GitLab.
